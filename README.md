## Objective
We aim to provide a digital curation of learning resources in the form of an interactive mobile application by leveraging already existing Free South African Primary and High School Textbooks like Mind the Gap. This means providing a gamification experience and improving accessibility of these learning resources by providing interactive study guides and tests, self/automatic homework evaluation, video and cartoon based tutorials/lessons. The goal is to have the application adopted in South African schools that are short of textbooks.


## Key Results: 2020
- Curate 100% of Grade 1 [english](https://za.ixl.com/standards/ela/grade-1) and [math](https://za.ixl.com/standards/maths/grade-1) lessons and tests into a cross-platform Mobile/Tablet application. 
- Provide first public release for use by grade 1 learners by the end of the year (1st December).
- We have a working Mobile/Tablet version on Google Play and Apple store.
- At most 20% of the features should require access to the internet. 
- ToDo: Research schools that are shot of textbooks, create a list and target adoption in those schools by mid-2021.
